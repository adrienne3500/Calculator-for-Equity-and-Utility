<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Based off the information detailed in the Results section of this memo, we have concluded that drastically reducing fixed utility charges, while slightly increasing variable utility charges, adding a separate charge for high usage which predominantly affects higher-income households, and increasing utility bill assistance for lower-income households, can result in significant relief from cost burden for millions of lower- to medium-income citizens, without higherâ€“income households experiencing energy cost burden and allowing the utility provider to make a reasonable level of profit.  As one can see from Table 3 and Table 4 in the Results section, the combined charge from electricity and gas on high-consumption households in the first, lowest income quintile decreased from a burden of 18.03% of annual income after taxes, to a percentage of 5.97% of annual income after taxes, which satisfies the requirement that low-income households pay no more than 6% of their annual income towards utility bills.
</p><p>Modifications to HEAP benefits were required along with modifications to utility rate structure to avoid imparting cost burden from electricity and gas payments. Average annual HEAP benefits were increased to $1090, an increase of 2,344% from $46.50, the average annual quantity of HEAP benefits distributed to New York City households[4]).  This tool has the potential to be used by both lawmakers and utility providers, possibly in direct cooperation, for the benefit of lower-income households who may be adversely impacted by utility cost burden.</p>
