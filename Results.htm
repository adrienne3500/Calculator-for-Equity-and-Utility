<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p>This section details the results obtained from the various modifications relating to rate structure and utility benefits for a given sample of households, for which data from New York City and Consolidated Edison, Inc. was utilized.
</p><p>As may be viewed in Tables 10 and 11, the rate structure changes have not significantly impacted revenue, with a percent difference of -0.01% between the values for revenue before and after the rate structure changes.  (The difference between these values for revenue and the $3,614 million revenue from residential sales of gas and electricity calculated using data from the 2019 Annual Report for Consolidated Edison, Inc[9] may be attributed in part to the fact that for neither utility was consumption adjusted based on usage of the other utility.)
</p><p>After repeated trial and error, values were found which suitably decreased the energy cost burden â€“ no household category needed to pay more than 6.00% of household income after taxes towards utility bills. 
</p><p>A constant multiplier of 0.0001 was used to multiply each of the original fixed charges for electricity and gas, and a constant multiplier of 1.002  was used to multiply each of the original variable per unit charges for electricity and gas.  After these multipliers were settled upon, an additional monthly charge for households in either of the second-highest expenditure categories (the high consumption category in the fourth income quintile and the medium consumption category in the fifth income quintile) was adjusted to a quantity of $88.50, while an additional monthly charge for households in the highest expenditure category was adjusted to a quantity of $179.67 to help compensate for revenue loss, while a quantity of $1090 was used to replace the original average annual HEAP benefit quantity for NYC households ($46.50[4]) to eliminate remaining cost burden.   
</p><p>These altered values (of which more may be found to satisfy cost and revenue constraints) helped to distribute cost burden across the income quintiles, with the lower income quintiles (those with pre-taxed incomes under 200% of the FPL) experiencing a decrease in cost burden and the higher quintiles experiencing an increase in costs but remaining below the 6% of household income that is considered cost burdened.  
</p><p>As may be seen in Tables 7, 8, and 9, there exists notable burden under the current rate structure, which may be reduced through the process detailed above.</p>
