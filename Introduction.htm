<h1><center>Calculator for the Joint Distribution of Income and Utility Costs: Addressing Energy Cost Burden</center></h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Relevant to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is financing investments in energy infrastructure decarbonization in a manner that is consumer-affordable.  Consumers of electricity and of gas in the United States are charged using two-part tariffs, one part being a fixed rate for utility usage (which is meant to recover fixed costs for the utility provider), and the other part being a variable rate for every unit of electricity or gas consumed (which is meant to recover variable costs for the utility provider).  Ideally, utility providers would have costs scaled to all levels of income, thereby preventing all lower-income households from experiencing energy cost burden (defined as paying over six percent of household income towards utility bills[4]); however, this is not the case.  Efforts to mitigate this issue of burden have emphasized decreasing fixed charges and increasing variable charges.
</p><p>As we unfortunately cannot know such income information with perfect accuracy, we have created a rate structure which correlates income and consumption (charging higher rates for households with higher consumption and lower rates for households with lower consumption), with decreased fixed charges and increased variable charges. 
</p><p>The goal of this study is to determine the rates which minimize or eliminate the fraction of households that are energy cost burdened, while allowing utility providers to cover costs and earn a customary profit, within regulator-defined limits. 
</p><p>This research has explored different ways of allocating costs among users through creation and utilization of a Microsoft Excel program. The Methods section of this report details the design process of the coding aspect of the Excel program, and how different standard inputs were designated. The Results section of this report explores sample calculated values resulting from utilization of the Excel program.   The Conclusion section of this report explores conclusions which may be drawn on inspection of how the program portrays equity across different income brackets.  The Appendix section of this report describes potentially unfamiliar terms in further depth.  The Sources section of this report includes the sources which were used in gathering data and other published figures, as well as a table illustrating how these sources correspond to the information described in this section.  The majority of the values utilized – described in the Methods section – were taken from Consolidated Edison and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (Please see Appendix for the sources and other published figures which were used in gathering data).</p>
